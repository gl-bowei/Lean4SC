This smart contract is a **yield farming contract**. The main functions include **mass harvesting unharvested rewards and harvesting rewards for specific epochs**. The contract operates through various states: **Epoch Initialization, Harvesting, and Completed Harvesting**. The transition between these states follows this logic: **First, users initialize epochs sequentially, then they can harvest rewards either in bulk or individually for each epoch. Upon harvesting, user rewards are transferred, and the state is updated to reflect the last harvested epoch**. The main variables include **epoch-related data, user harvest records, and total distributed amounts**. The main functions consist of **massHarvest, harvest, and epoch management methods**. Key events are **MassHarvest and Harvest**, which trigger upon successful reward distributions.
