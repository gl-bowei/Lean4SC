This smart contract is a **token contract** for managing an ERC20 token called "wka". The main functions include **transferring tokens, approving spending by others, and checking balances and allowances**. The main states of the contract revolve around **token ownership and transferability**. The logical process for transitioning between states involves **initializing the token supply during contract deployment, executing transfers between accounts, and enabling approvals for third-party spending**. The main variables consist of **balances, allowed allowances, total supply, symbol, name, and decimals**. Key functions include **transfer, approve, transferFrom, balanceOf, and totalSupply**. Important events include **Transfer and Approval** to signal significant actions undertaken by the token contract.
