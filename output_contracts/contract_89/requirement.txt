The contract also prevents direct ETH transfers and allows the owner to recover any mistakenly sent ERC20 tokens]. The main variables include [symbol, name, decimals, totalSupply, balances, and allowed]. The main functions are [totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, approve, transferFrom, and allowance]. The main events include [Transfer and Approval].
