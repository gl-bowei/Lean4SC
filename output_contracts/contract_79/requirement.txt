This smart contract is a [token contract] designed for minting and managing ERC1155 tokens. The main functions include [minting tokens, setting the base URI for metadata, and retrieving token metadata]. The contract operates in the following states: [Token Minting and Metadata Management]. The process logic for state transitions is as follows: [The contract owner can mint tokens by specifying the token ID, amount, and recipient address. The owner can also update the base URI for token metadata. Users can retrieve the metadata URI for a specific token ID, which is constructed using the base URI and the token ID]. The main variables include [baseTokenUri, name, and symbol]. The main functions include [mint, setBaseTokenURI, and uri]. The main events are not explicitly defined in the provided code.
