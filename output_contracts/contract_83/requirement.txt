This smart contract is a [signature validation contract]. The main functions include [generating signatures for transactions and validating those signatures]. The main states of the contract include [Signature Generation and Signature Validation]. The process logic for the transition of states is as follows: [First, a user calls the generateSignature function to create a signature for a transaction directed to the seed factory. The contract checks the validity of the parameters and ensures the transaction has not been signed before. Upon successful generation, the signature is stored, and an event is emitted. The contract can then validate signatures using the isValidSignature function]. The main variables include [approvedSignatures, safe, and seedFactory]. The main functions include [generateSignature and isValidSignature]. The main events include [SignatureCreated].
