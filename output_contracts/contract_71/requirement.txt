This smart contract is a [controller for a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol]. The main functions include [setting parameters for governance, querying oracle prices, calculating impact costs, and managing caller permissions]. The primary states of the contract involve [parametrization, price querying, and cost calculation]. The process logic transitions through states as follows: [Initially, governance sets parameters and allows certain call permissions. Users can then query price information and receive calculated K-values based on oracle data. Finally, impact costs for operations such as swapping, burning, or minting tokens are computed based on the current market state]. The main variables include [governance address, oracle, nestToken, timespan, and KInfoMap]. The central functions encompass [setGovernance, queryOracle, and calcImpactCost]. Key events include [NewTimespan, NewK, and NewCGamma].
