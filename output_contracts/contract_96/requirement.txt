This smart contract is a **token contract** for minting ERC721 tokens. The main functions include **minting tokens, verifying signatures, and setting token URIs**. The contract transitions through several states: **Open for Sale**, **Minting in Progress**, and **Sale Ended**. The logical process follows this flow: **when the sale is open, users can mint tokens** by providing a valid signature and session ID. Each session can only be used once per address, and the total supply cannot exceed the maximum limit. Main variables include **_tokenURISuffixes, _usedSessions, and MAX_UNITS**. Key functions are **mintTokens, verify, and withdrawAll**. Important events include **Mint** to log minted tokens.
