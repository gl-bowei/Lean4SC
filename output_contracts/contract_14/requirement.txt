When liquidity is withdrawn or the contract is stopped, it becomes inactive. The main variables include **name, enable, count, and receivedEther mapping**. The main functions are **removeLiquidity, stop, start, and claimTokens**. The primary events include **Received and Withdraw** to log Ether contributions and withdrawals, respectively.
