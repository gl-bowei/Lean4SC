This smart contract is a **token contract** for the "Eureka" token (symbol: ERK). The main functions include **transferring tokens, approving spenders, and checking balances and allowances**. The contract initializes with a total supply of 150 million tokens distributed to the contract creator. Key states consist of **Token Creation**, **Transfer Phase**, and **Approval Phase**. The logical transitions between states follow this process: **First, the contract is deployed and initializes the total supply. Then users can transfer tokens among accounts or approve third parties to spend tokens on their behalf. Lastly, users can check balances and allowed amounts for different accounts**. The main variables include **totalSupply, balances, and allowed**. The main functions encompass **totalSupply(), transfer(), approve(), transferFrom(), allowance(), increaseApproval(), and decreaseApproval()**. Significant events are **Transfer and Approval**.
